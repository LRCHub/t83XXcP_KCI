Lonely in this crowd,
I sit alone, oh
One more drink away from
heading home, oh
Oh,
I could feel the night
slipping by
Oh, away from me
And, oh,
she caught my eye through
the light
Then she came right up to me
She said, "Oh, hi,
nice to meet you
Tonight, maybe we could
Go dance, get up off our feet"
She said,
"This life ain't forever
One song, here together
Then let's play it on repeat"
We could dance,
we could dance all night
We could dance till the
morning light
Let's forget about our
worries and the wild
world outside
She said, "Oh, hi,
nice to meet you
Tonight, maybe we could
Go dance, get up off our feet"
We could dance,
we could dance all night
She took my hand and led
me through the dark, oh
She said, "Feel the beat,
forget that broken heart", oh
And, oh,
I can feel the night
slipping by
Oh, away from me
And, oh,
I saw the light in her eyes
Glad she came right up to me
She said, "Oh, hi,
nice to meet you
Tonight, maybe we could
Go dance, get up off our feet"
She said,
"This life ain't forever
One song, here together
Then let's play it on repeat"
We could dance,
we could dance all night
We could dance till the
morning light
Let's forget about our
worries and the wild
world outside
She said, "Oh, hi,
nice to meet you
Tonight, maybe we could
Go dance, get up off our feet"
We could dance,
we could dance all night
We could dance,
we could dance all night
She said, "Oh, hi,
nice to meet you
Tonight, maybe we could
Go dance, get up off our feet"
She said,
"This life ain't forever
One song, here together
Then let's play it on repeat"
We could dance,
we could dance all night
