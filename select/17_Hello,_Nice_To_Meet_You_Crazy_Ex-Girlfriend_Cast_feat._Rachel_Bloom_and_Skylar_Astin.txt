Hello, nice to meet you
You've been inside of me

Hello, nice to meet you
You broke my heart
Aaaw
Pleased to make your acquaintance, stranger
I've spent many years processing my anger
Wouldn't know what to say to the person I knew
But it's nice to meet you
Oh, ma'am, your baguette!
It's funny, you remind me of this guy
Whom I labeled as toxic

Yeah, in a certain light you look like
This girl who screwed my best friend
Ugh, she sounds like a bitch
Yeah, she kinda was
We've met before
But I really can't place it

Oh, was it that time
We ate pizza naked?

Right! That night was sick
I ate sauce off your --

Yes, and that burned
Ouch
It's nice to meet you
I mean is anyone we meet
Really that new to us
We're all the same species
That grew in a uterus

A kiss is a kiss

But to be fair
It's not every day your Doc asks
"How did sauce get in there?"

Hello, nice to meet you
You seem really cool

Hello, nice to meet you
I am indeed really cool
If you have a message
For my doppelganger
I'm happy to pass it
Along as a favor

Tell her I have her scrunchie

I still have his coat

Tell her she kissed good

Tell him I have notes
Ouch
Tell him it's sad
That he had to hide

Tell her arrabbiata
Is not for inside

Tell him I'm sorry

Tell her I am too
Now that's settled
It's nice to meet you
It's nice to meet you
In various meet cutes
It's nice to meet you
