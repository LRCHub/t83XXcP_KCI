September has come and gone
Those four weeks had gone by so quickly
Patient driving alone
Pained from excitement
On my way to Chicago
Hi is nice to meet you
Hi is nice to meet you
I be straight with you
On what we're hoping for

I be safe with you
Your heart beats on an
Open door
Hi it's nice to meet you
Hi it's nice to meet you
