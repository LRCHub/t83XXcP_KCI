Hello it's really nice to meet you
At last it's really nice to meet you

Throw me a party on a sunny afternoon
A pleasant surprise you know you didn't have to
Nice decorations flowers everywhere
Everyone is cheering you know they care

Covered in my favorite color
Roses bleed so beautiful
And why is red my favorite color
And please tell me how did you know

Enter the devil in shiny coat and pants
Calling my name you know he does a dance
Tease me for hours this isn't any fun
The crown cheers as if it just begun

Hello it's really nice to meet you
At last it's really nice to meet you
Although it's really nice to meet you
So long I'm gonna have to kill you
