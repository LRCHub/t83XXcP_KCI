I heard that girls don't like guys with no ambition
I heard that people don't like being told what to do
It's ground for secession
I heard that nobody likes their 9 to 5's
But we line up to get them
I heard that rock is dead and cellphones
Give you cancer

I heard that kindness kills and
Charity is selfish
Why do people take so much time to make
Themselves look like they don't care
I heard that parents
Don't like when band guys
Date their daughters
I heard the world
Is gonna end so we're not
Paying our taxes

America nice to meet you
So this is paradise
I've heard a lot of things
But I've seen nothing
America nice to meet you

I can't watch the news today
It feels my head with nightmares
I felt the floor collapse
Beneath my feet it's a slow climb
Back to the top to the times that we felt
We can provide for ourselves and our families

I heard that things will change
I'm just so tired of waiting

America nice to meet you
So this is paradise
I've heard a lot of things
But I've seen nothing
America nice to meet you

La-La

I've heard a lot of things
But I've seen nothing

America nice to meet you
So this is paradise
I've heard a lot of things
But I've seen nothing

America nice to meet you
So this is paradise
I've heard a lot of things
But I've seen nothing

America nice to meet you
