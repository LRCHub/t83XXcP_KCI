I didn't know when I arrived
I'd meet someone like you tonight
I'm in my head paralyzed
No way to display my better side

Spinning around in the dark
You know you're what I'm looking for
Say the words in my heart
Tell me that you feel the spark

Cause I can turn a crush into a love
In no time at all
Cause we're both gonna die
Not wasting all this precious life
Not wasting my time
Or waiting more
Waiting all my life to start

It's so nice to meet you in the dark
As long as it takes you and me to fall in love
It feels so good to touch you in the dark
As long as it takes you and me to fall in love

You didn't know the warning signs
Dancing right into my soul
Take the knife, cut my ties
Should I stay or should I go
I want to dance and feel the spark
Can you feel the spark

Cause I can turn a crush into a love
In no time at all
Cause we're both gonna die
Not wasting all this precious life
Not wasting my time
Or waiting more
Waiting all my life to start

It's so nice to meet you in the dark
As long as it takes you and me to fall in love
It feels so good to touch you in the dark
As long as it takes you and me to fall in love
